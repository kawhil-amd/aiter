"""MXFP4 paged MQA logits (OPUS) -- correctness and perf, through the arch dispatcher.

Emits five tables -- the corner cases, a causal prefill sweep, ATOM's two CSA-compressed
prefill regimes (fresh, and chunked at PR #5332's shapes so the two PRs are comparable), and
an MTP decode sweep -- as markdown for a reader and as one-line JSON records for a benchmark
driver.

Every launch goes through ``aiter.ops.opus.pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4``, the arch dispatcher, rather
than an arch arm directly -- so the path under test is the path a caller gets, layout check
included, and ONE file covers every target the op is built for. ``SUPPORTED_GFX`` below is that
list; it is gfx1250 alone today and gains gfx950 when #5332 folds its implementation into the
same dispatcher.

    python3 op_tests/test_pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_opus.py             # the full default sweep
    python3 op_tests/test_pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_opus.py -b 1 2      # a quick subset
    python3 op_tests/test_pa_mqa_logits_mxfp4_opus.py \\
        --data-init constant uniform --scale-init constant auto   # two paired init regimes

DATA AND SCALE ARE TWO INDEPENDENT AXES, not "sample the data then derive the scale by
quantizing it". The reference dequantizes whatever ``(nibbles, E8M0)`` pair comes out, which is
defined for any pair, so nothing downstream needs the two to be consistent -- and the exponents
are then a property of the SCALE axis alone.

THAT MATTERS BECAUSE THE SPREAD IS LOAD-BEARING. Where neighbouring KV tokens carry the same
exponent, a scale routed to the WRONG token reads one that happens to be right: a deliberately
misrouted ``b_scale_sel`` passed the standalone suite at ``cos = 0.999952`` on flat-magnitude
data and only failed at 0.396 once the exponents spread. ``b_scale_sel`` misroutes across a
lane HALF, so the number that matters is how often rows 16 apart disagree -- a spread periodic
in 16 would be as blind as none. ``scale_spread`` measures both, and ``correctness_blindness``
SKIPS the correctness sweep with the reason in the table for a pair that cannot judge, because
a probe that cannot fail gets quoted as evidence.

There is no second implementation to cross-check against on this target -- gfx1250 has no
FlyDSL fp4 MQA-logits kernel -- so the dequantized fp32 reference is the only judge. It runs
over the same quantized values the kernel sees, so ``err`` is expected at ~1e-6 (fp32
accumulation order), not at fp4 resolution. The K-permutation and scale-routing probes a
reference cannot give live in the opus-ops standalone harness.

    ``cu_seq_q[batch]`` is device data, so no launcher check can compare it against
    ``q.shape[0]`` -- reading it host-side is the sync this whole design exists to avoid.
    Unbounded, the chain ``cu_seq_q -> cu_tiles -> rec.row_id -> row_id`` puts a CTA's reads
    past ``q`` / ``q_scale`` / ``weights`` and its WRITES past ``out``. The kernel bounds
    ``row_id`` against ``num_rows`` instead, so the surplus rows are dropped and the real ones
    stay right.

    THIS CASE IS THE ONLY THING THAT WALKS THAT PATH -- every other case here builds
    ``cu_seq_q`` and ``q`` from one ``qlens``, so the rows always agree.

    **What gives it teeth is the oversized `out`, not the hope of a fault.** With a
    right-sized one the unbounded kernel overruns by 4 KB, which the caching allocator usually
    absorbs: no fault, no wrong answer in the rows that are checked, and the probe passes while
    establishing nothing. So `out` is allocated for all ``claimed`` rows and the surplus ones
    are required to stay at their -inf pre-fill. That is the same `row_id` the overrun would
    have used, so it tests the bound and not a symptom.

    Both clauses need a tile WIDER than one row, so only the qshare instances put the per-wave
    half on the path; at one row per CTA the cut is `[0,1) .. [13,14)`, no tile straddles
    ``real`` and the CTA-uniform clause is the only one that can fire. Run on both anyway --
    the CTA-uniform half is the one that bounds the store, and it is the whole probe there.
